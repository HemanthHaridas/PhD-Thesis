    \caption[Time series plots for the z-coordinate of the center-of-mass of nucleotides at the 3’-end of the ssDNA obtained from additive simulations]{Time series plots for the z-coordinate of the center-of-mass of nucleotides at the 3’-end of the ssDNA obtained from additive simulations. The z-coordinate of the top (red) and the bottom (blue) sheet are also presented to indicate the relative distance of the 3’-end nucleotides to the graphene sheet. Time-series have been plotted till complete translocation is observed, or for 500 ns in case of incomplete translocations. Variations in the applied external bias have also been indicated.}

The z-coordinate of the top (red) and the bottom (blue) sheet are also presented to indicate the relative distance of the 3’-end nucleotides to the graphene sheet. Time-series have been plotted till complete translocation is observed, or for 200 ns in case of incomplete translocations. Variations in the applied external bias have also been indicated.}
